This is a repository displaying some of the Terraform Projects I have done, along with CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps & GitHub Actions

The highlights of the workflows are a CI/CD projects that I have applied in real enterprise environments that automate deployment of Terraform Infrastructure, 
automate the provisioning of DNS servers, as well as a script that automates the starting of VMs on Azure for free without using Azure Functions, in a modular,
scalable, and immutable way.

The modules folder contains various modules I have created and deployed to increase the immutablility of infrastructure in real enterprise environments. The most
impressive of these is the Azure Kubernetes Service module, which allows for quick and automated deployment of a managed Kubernetes Cluster. This increases immutability
in infrastructure and automates deployment of relatively complex infrastructure, highly efficiently.
